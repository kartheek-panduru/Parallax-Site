        <p1>Parallax scrolling is a web design technique in which the website background moves at a slower pace than the foreground. This results in a 3D effect as visitors scroll down the site, adding a sense of depth and creating a more immersive browsing experience.


            Parallax is based on optical illusion. Since the human eye perceives objects that are close to us as larger than things farther away, we perceive distant objects as if they were moving more slowly.
            
            
            The illusion has been long adopted into parallax across different mediums, fostering a realistic effect. Its first use was in traditional animation, dating back to as early as Disney’s Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, and in video games such as Super Mario. 
            
            However, as you scroll down, the front layer moves faster than the back layers. As a result, the scenery looks three-dimensional as you scroll. Note that the front layer has moved a ton, but the back layer has hardly moved at all. That’s parallax.
            
            However, language has a funny way of evolving over time. Since many parallax websites fit all the website content into one page, the definition has started to change. Now, even industry professionals will call any single-page scrolling website “parallax,” even if the website doesn’t use a parallax effect.
            
            Sure, “Parallax” meaning “singe page” may not be prescriptively correct, but that’s how many professionals use the word now. Besides, you can’t break the lines if you listen to prescriptivists.
We could argue about the merits of each definition for days, but let’s focus on what both definitions have in common: the website fits into one long, scrolling page. This design choice comes with some pros and cons-especially with respect to design and SEO.<br></p1>

        <p2>Ingenious take on the parallax scrolling effect adds depth and motion to his already captivating homepage design.


            By dividing the page into full-width strips, site visitors are met with exhilarating shots of aquatic life each time they scroll down further. The strips float gently above one another, using a mix of both parallax and reveal scrolling effects.  
            
            
            Giving the photographs even more movement are minute animations. While these are barely discernible, the website animations - combined with the use of parallax and video - make this page fully come to life.
            
            Parallax websites aren’t as common as traditional ones, but they can be extremely useful in certain contexts. Parallax websites are perfect for the user journey. Since all the content appears as the user scrolls, you can refine the user journey, strengthen your brand story, and streamline your funnel. Parallax websites can look pretty cool. Dynamic animations, stunning graphics, and high-quality graphics can make a parallax website breathtaking. As a result, parallax websites usually have a lower bounce rate. 
            A parallax website costs less than a traditional website because you only need to pay for one page. Of course, this page isn’t small, but it’s still only one page. They’re a great choice for businesses that want a high-quality scalable website.<br></p2>

        <p3>Parallax isn’t perfect. Otherwise, every website would be parallax. It comes with a few drawbacks. Not Enough Pages is the biggest issue: parallax websites are single-page. If Google only indexes one page, you won’t rank for nearly as many keywords. Plus, you’ll be limited to only one H1 title.
            
            Long Load Time - You can only fit so much content into one page before it slows down. If your entire website fits onto one page, it won’t load as fast-especially if it uses a parallax effect or other dynamic animations. Simply put, parallax websites take time to load.
            
            Browser/Mobile Compatibility - Dynamic graphics and big animations may have trouble loading on certain browsers or mobile devices.
            These problems are huge, but only if left unattended. If you know what you’re doing, you can solve all these issues.
            If a parallax website is the best fit for you, don’t worry about the SEO. Just design a high-quality, high-performance website for your target audience and Google will rank you. If you meet their needs, they’ll come to your website.
            <br><strong>It’s that simple.</strong><br></p3>
